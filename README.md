# Demo Scripts
This is a repository where I "throw" different scripts in python that perform small but useful tasks.
I am hoping that moving fwd I will be able to include more complicated and more interesting scripts that will be doing
many more tasks. If anyone is interested in throwing my way tasks they want to accomplish in python
I would be interested in looking into it.

Thank you
